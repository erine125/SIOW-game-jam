	Fern	Oh, wow, this place is new. 	#201411		3
	Ginger	Freshly renovated! My partner and I moved here from Cocoa Valley three years ago -- he makes the bread, I run the business. To think our small bakery would expand to a beautiful town like this one...	#201411		4
	Ginger	But look at me, talking your ear off... take a look around, and let me know if you have any questions!	#201411	MakeReluctant
