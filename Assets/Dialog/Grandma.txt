1	Fern	Grandma? It's good to see you.	#201411		2
	Grandma	Oh my stars... how long has it been? You've gotten so big!	#201411		3
	Grandma	You were still the size of a wee bean the last I saw you…	#201411		4
	Fern	I stopped growing when I was, like, sixteen… 	#201411		5
	Grandma	Well, I'm just happy to see you, dear. I've missed seeing that little sprout head of yours.	#201411		6
	Fern	Grandma!	#201411		7
	Fern	Never mind. How's your health? Indy said you weren't well.	#201411		8
	Grandma	Oh, that child's a worrier. But I'm so glad you two are still so close!	#201411		9
	Fern	We're not.	#201411		10
	Fern	What can I do for you, Grandma? Water or maybe groceries? You probably need your rest.	#201411		11
	Grandma	Oh, dear. You finally visit after all these years and I don't even have the strength to cook for you... I've just had so little energy these days.	#201411		12
	Grandma	But don't you worry, poppet, I'll be alright. You didn't need to come all the way here from the city. Don't you have school?	#201411		13
	Fern	I graduated. And it's fine. I wanted to take care of you.	#201411		14
	Fern	I should have been here sooner.	#201411		15
	Grandma	Well, dear, it's as I always say. Even the most unruly of knots can be fixed with care and effort. Let's not dwell on mistakes, darling; there is always time to correct them.	#201411		16
	Grandma	Oh! That reminds me. Would you be a dear and go fetch my old knitting needles? They're in the attic, and getting up there is such a pain these days. These old bones don't like clambering over things quite so much anymore...	#201411		17
	Fern	Your knitting needles? You don't mean your magic needles?	#201411		18
	Fern	Grandma, if you can't even make it to the attic, do you really think you should be going out and doing magic again?	#201411		19
	Grandma	Darling, this town needs someone to look after it. It needs its needlemancer! The threads of fate that tie our community together would come undone without upkeep.	#201411		20
	Grandma	Ever since the founding of Purl Coast, our ancestors and the magic they passed down --	#201411		21
	Fern	You don't have to tell the story again, Grandma.	#201411		22
	Fern	I know you love helping everyone, and I know how important this is.	#201411	MakeReluctant	23
	Fern	Fine, I'll get the needles. But then I'm making you some dinner.	#201411	UpdateState2	
2	Grandma	Dear, did you find the knitting needles?	#201411		25
	Grandma	They're tucked away in the very back of the attic. You can't miss them! You might have to jump a bit to grab them, though, with your small stature. Don't worry -- once you pick them up, you'll have a much easier time.	#201411		26
	Fern	What's that supposed to mean?	#201411		27
	Grandma	Dear, you've been knitting since the day you were born! The needles will work their magic for you. I just know it.	#201411	MakeReluctant	
3	Grandma	Wonderful! Looks like these old things still have some shine to them.	#201411		29
	Fern	It's really been a while, hasn't it.	#201411		30
	Grandma	When you get old like me, you stop worrying about things like that. 	#201411		31
	Grandma	And I can still sense the magic running through them... Darling, did you use them? Did the magic work for you?	#201411		32
	Fern	I mean, I tried. But I'm not you, Grandma. I don't have the skills you have with magic.	#201411		33
	Grandma	All in good time, darling. But for now -- what day is it today, dear? My memory isn't what it used to be.	#201411		34
	Fern	It's Tuesday.	#201411		35
	Grandma	Ah... it's that day of the week, isn't it.	#201411		36
	Fern	What do you mean?	#201411		37
	Grandma	Do you remember what the duties of a needlemancer are, my dear?	#201411		38
	Fern	Kind of.	#201411		39
	Fern	Helping the town, stuff like that.	#201411		40
	Grandma	Indeed! For years, I and those who wielded the magic needles before me have channeled the powers of this ancient magic...	#201411		41
	Fern	Grandma, I feel like you're making it sound more mystical than it is. I'm not a kid anymore.	#201411		42
	Grandma	Hoho! Don't I know it. Either way, this magic is potent stuff, and it's necessary to keep our town close knit and together! The powerful threads of fate must be maintained!	#201411		43
	Fern	Alright, Grandma. As ridiculous as you make it sound... I get how important this is. But you still shouldn't be going around town! You need rest!	#201411		44
	Grandma	Oh, listen here, dear.	#201411		45
	Grandma	There's a young lady working at the library. Scarlett.	#201411		46
	Grandma	The library is a busy place. Our community relies on it to archive our history! But Scarlett insists she can handle it all by herself. A little uptight, that one. But sweet on the inside. Kind of like you, my dear!	#201411		47
	Fern	Hey!	#201411		48
	Grandma	She's got her system, everything in its place, all that. But an extra pair of hands never hurt. Certainly it can't be easy running an operation of such size! Now, normally on Tuesdays I go see her myself, but of course...	#201411		49
	Fern	You don't mean...	#201411		50
	Grandma	Fern, my dear, do me a favor and go in my stead?	#201411		51
	Fern	What? I can't do that!	#201411		52
	Fern	I've never worked at a library... and I just said it, I barely know anything about your needle magic!	#201411		53
	Fern	Come on, Grandma, I'm not like you. I'd probably just make things worse. No one wants that.	#201411		54
	Grandma	Oh, dear, don't fret your little sprout head about it. I'm only asking for you to check up on how she's doing. No magic required.	#201411		55
	Fern	...Fine. But does she even need my help?	#201411		56
	Fern	I'm sure she doesn't want it.	#201411	MakeReluctant	57
	Grandma	Oh, dear, stop your worrying. Just go and see! And don't forget your needles, hoho!	#201411	UpdateState4	
4	Grandma	Do you need help finding your way to the library, dear? It's certainly been a while since you've been away from home, hasn't it!	#201411		59
	Grandma	When you leave home, turn right, and go past the Art Market. Oh, those little crafts and trinkets are so gorgeous! I always love stopping by to see what everyone in town is making these days. We're a crafty bunch, that's for sure!	#201411		60
	Fern	Grandma, stop getting distracted!	#201411		61
	Grandma	Oh, you'll have to forgive me, darling. Anyway, once you go past the Art Market, just head north and you should see the library! It's a grand building, with that beautiful golden dome on top. You can't miss it!	#201411	MakeReluctant	
6	Grandma	Welcome home, dear! You're just in time. My radio show just ended!	#201411		63
	Grandma	How is Scarlett doing? Not too swamped with work I hope?	#201411		64
	Fern	She'll be alright. I didn't even really do any magic. I think maybe she just needed someone to talk to. 	#201411		65
	Grandma	And that's all it takes, dear! But I do see some magic sparkling on those needles...	#201411		66
	Fern	Are you sure it's not just your eyesight, Grandma?	#201411		67
	Grandma	How rude! I'll have you know I'm still sharp as a hawk. But I know you didn't mean anything by it, dear.	#201411		68
	Grandma	And thank you for helping out with my duties. I know you just got home and you've barely settled back in! 	#201411		69
	Fern	It's no trouble at all, Grandma, really.	#201411		70
	Grandma	Well, then, why don't you help your dear old gran out with one more thing?	#201411		71
	Fern	Of course. Errands, chores, whatever you need.	#201411		72
	Fern	...But why do I get the feeling that's not what you mean?	#201411		73
	Grandma	You must have passed by the little bakery in town. It's just north of here! They opened after you left, and you simply must try their chiffon cakes! Oh, and they make the most delightful little cream puffs... I'm getting excited just thinking about them.	#201411		74
	Fern	Sure, I can grab us some dessert, Grandma. 	#201411		75
	Grandma	No, no, that's not what I mean. There's a lovely couple that runs the place -- Ginger and Jasper. So sweet, but always swarmed with orders. And always bickering.	#201411		76
	Grandma	I suppose when business is booming, things get stressful! Now, as part of my needlemancer duties...	#201411		77
	Fern	I see where this is going. Grandma, I told you, I can't do magic like you. I don't have the experience. 	#201411		78
	Grandma	Well, it seems like your time with Scarlett was a great success.	#201411		79
	Fern	That wasn't any magic. I just got lucky and said the right things. It doesn't mean anything.	#201411		80
	Fern	It's not that I don't want to. I love knitting, and I loved watching you do magic as a kid. But I just...	#201411		81
	Grandma	Just what, dear?	#201411		82
	Fern	Never mind. I'll go.	#201411	MakeReluctant	83
	Grandma	Wonderful! And bring us back some cream puffs!	#201411	UpdateState7	
7	Grandma	Dear, did you get lost? 	#201411		85
	Grandma	The bakery is just north of here. Take a right outside the house and head up -- they're right above us!	#201411	MakeReluctant	
8	Grandma	How did it go at the bakery, dear?	#201411		87
	Fern	Alright, I think. I didn't do any magic this time, either. I think they just needed someone to hear them out, someone to make them realize their relationship matters too, not just their business.	#201411		88
	Fern	I think they're going to close the bakery down for a bit. Just until they've figured things out. But I did get the cream puffs.	#201411		89
	Grandma	Wonderful! I'll miss those dear little pastries, but seeing our community come together is sweeter than anything. I can feel the threads of fate growing stronger and stronger!	#201411		90
	Fern	What are you talking about, Grandma? I literally haven't done any magic.	#201411		91
	Grandma	And yet I can feel our bonds strengthening. Whatever you're doing, dear, it's special, and I'm so proud of you.	#201411		92
	Fern	For what? I'm not doing anything special. I'm just talking to people.	#201411		93
	Grandma	Well, I think you've done a great job. The needles' magic is sparkling for you!	#201411	MakeReluctant	94
	Grandma	I think I need some rest. Oh! Your friend Indy stopped by, said to meet them in the sewers... something about where you guys used to hang out? I remember you two climbing down the manhole uptown...	#201411	UpdateState9	
9	Grandma	<i>She's sleeping. She looks so much frailer than you remember.</i>	#201411		96
	Grandma	<i>You think maybe your vision of Grandma is still that of your childhood. She was the town's hero. She could do anything. You could never live up to that.</i>	#201411		97
	Grandma	<i>Grandma always says she's proud of you. And you wonder how she can be, when she's so strong, so capable. And you're just... you.</i>	#201411	MakeReluctant	
10	Fern	Grandma...	#201411		99
	Grandma	Is something the matter, dear?	#201411		100
	Fern	I love it. I do. I love knitting.	#201411		101
	Fern	Every stitch and every loop makes me love it even more.	#201411		102
	Fern	Even when I lose count of the rows, even when I mess up... I just want to keep going.	#201411		103
	Fern	I fail, and I just want to continue knitting! Just because I love it! For me, that's... that's enough.	#201411		104
	Fern	I don't know if I can help others. I know everyone's saying I helped them, but... even now, there's this little voice in my head. Telling me that they're just saying that to be nice.	#201411		105
	Fern	But... I want to believe them. That I made a difference... a small one, maybe. But a difference.	#201411		106
	Fern	I know I'm not good enough. I can't be organized like Scarlett, ambitious and creative like the bakers, decisive like Indy...	#201411		107
	Fern	And I can't use magic the way you can, Grandma. I can't knit as quickly and as precisely as you. I don't think I ever will.	#201411		108
	Fern	But I want to do it. I want to be the next needlemancer. I know I'm not ready yet, but...	#201411		109
	Fern	I've never wanted so badly to be enough.	#201411		110
	Grandma	Oh, sweetie...	#201411		111
	Grandma	Do any of us really know what we're doing? Even at my old age, I still make mistakes. 	#201411		112
	Grandma	And even in my youth, nothing I made was perfect. That little scarf I gave you before you left had mistakes too. I've always felt that small thing wasn't good enough for my little girl.	#201411		113
	Fern	But I love that scarf.	#201411		114
	Grandma	That warms my heart.	#201411		115
	Grandma	We all have our doubts. 	#201411		116
	Grandma	If you really want to, there is a way to know for certain if you're ready.	#201411		117
	Fern	How?	#201411		118
	Grandma	High above the mountains lies the shrine of our ancestors.	#201411		119
	Grandma	They will appear and acknowledge the next needlemancer. It is an ancient ritual... hoho!	#201411		120
	Grandma	I too climbed to the top to receive the title of needlemancer. But the path is perilous, poppet. It will not be an easy climb. And I shall not force you.	#201411		121
	Fern	...	#201411		122
	Fern	I just... need to hear I can do this. 	#201411		123
	Fern	If I can get their acknowledgment, I'll do it.	#201411		124
	Grandma	You've made up your mind, I see. Stay safe, sweetheart.	#201411		125
	Grandma	As much as I want to, I can't go up there with you. But I'll teach you a trick.	#201411		126
	Grandma	It's a little trick I learned in my youth... though it's more difficult to pull off now. 	#201411		127
	Grandma	When throwing your needle, press <b>right click</b> instead for a little boost!	#201411		128
	Grandma	Maybe it'll help propel you where you need to go.	#201411	UpdateState11	
11	Grandma	Are you still nervous about climbing the mountain, dear?	#201411		130
	Grandma	Remember the trick I taught you. Press <b>right click</b> to propel yourself when throwing the needle... it'll take you to higher places, my dear!	#201411	MakeReluctant
