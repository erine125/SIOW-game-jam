12	Indy	Fern? Are you alright?	#201411		2
	Fern	Indy? Everyone? What are you all doing here?	#201411		3
	Fern	And how did you get up here?	#201411		4
	Indy	We took the tram... How did <i>you</i> get up here?	#201411		5
	Fern	I climbed... I used the magic needles. I thought... I thought I could do it, but...	#201411		6
	Fern	The ritual failed. Nothing happened.	#201411		7
	Fern	I... I failed.	#201411		8
	Fern	I'm not going to be the next needlemancer. I'm sorry, everyone.	#201411		9
	Indy	What do you mean? Just now you were so sure. Why do you need some ritual to prove it to yourself?	#201411		10
	Fern	But the shrine -- my grandma said --	#201411		11
	Indy	Who cares about the shrine? Look, everyone's here. You brought us all closer together. Isn't that the entire job?	#201411		12
	Scarlett	Yes, and you do realize you've been doing it the entire time, right?	#201411		13
	Fern	What?	#201411		14
	Scarlett	Do you not know your history? Those needles would never work for you if you weren't worthy of wielding them. You might have thought you weren't doing any magic, but...	#201411		15
	Fern	...	#201411		16
	Scarlett	Besides, that ritual is a total fairytale. The ancestors of Purl Coast aren't buried here; they're buried in the graveyard. Which you would know if you ever cracked open a history book.	#201411		17
	Fern	Hey!	#201411		18
	Ginger	I think the point she's trying to make, love, is that there are no ancestor spirits. There is no magic council to deem you worthy. Not here, anyway.	#201411		19
	Fern	Then... why would Grandma send me here?	#201411		20
	Indy	Well, maybe it has to do with the fact that, by the time you got up here, you proved to yourself you could.	#201411		21
	Indy	Why prove it to anyone else?	#201411		22
	Jasper	Yes! The real ritual was the friends you made along the way!	#201411		23
	Ginger	Not quite, love... But it doesn't matter. Fern, you don't need magic. You have skill, patience, and a love of the craft. Isn't that enough?	#201411		24
	Scarlett	You might not know the difference between a knit and a purl, but you cared enough to keep going.	#201411		25
	Jasper	Are you feeling better now? If not, I have cream puffs waiting for you! My new recipe!	#201411		26
	Indy	See? Come on. Let's go home.	#201411		27
	Indy	This is your home, right?	#201411		28
	Fern	...	#201411		29
	Fern	Alright. Let's go.	#201411	UpdateState13
