1	Palpatine	Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise?			2	10
	Anakin	No.			3	
	Palpatine	I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis... was a Dark Lord of the Sith so powerful and so wise, he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians... to create... life. He had such a knowledge of the dark side, he could even keep the ones he cared about... from dying.			4	
	Anakin	He could actually... save people from death?			5	
	Palpatine	The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities... some consider to be unnatural.			6	
	Anakin	Whâ€“ What happened to him?			7	
	Palpatine	He became so powerful, the only thing he was afraid of was... losing his power. Which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew. Then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.			8	
	Anakin	Is it possible to learn this power?			9	
	Palpatine	Not from a Jedi.				
	Anakin	Yes.			11	
	Palpatine	Oh. Well I kinda had this whole speech thing			12	13
	Anakin	Yeah, I don't care, I'm leaving				
	Anakin	Okay, go ahead then, I wasn't paying much attention when Obi Wan talked about it anyways			3	
2	Palpatine	Lord Vader, can you hear me?			15	
	Anakin	Yes, My Master.			16	
	Anakin	Where is Padme? Is she safe, is she all right?			17	
	Palpatine	I'm afraid she died. ... it seems in your anger, you killed her.			18	
	Anakin	I couldn't have! She was alive! I felt her! She was alive! It's impossible! No!!!
